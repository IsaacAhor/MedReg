# Active Task Queue

**Active Tasks:** 1
**Next Task:** Wire Queues into UI using Location UUIDs

**For Workers:** CRITICAL task ready for implementation - see Task 11 below.

**Important:**
- Holistic Build & Integration Rule (MANDATORY): Every task must ensure the backend, frontend, REST, and app UI still work together end-to-end. Do not break the app.
- If your task requires OpenMRS backend work (database, Java, Spring config), see [OPENMRS_PROMPT_GUIDE.md](../OPENMRS_PROMPT_GUIDE.md) for specialized workflow.

**When new tasks are added:**
- [ ] Read AGENTS.md Task Management Workflow section
- [ ] Change status to [WIP] IN PROGRESS when starting
- [ ] Execute ALL steps (no skipping)
- [ ] Run ALL verification commands
  - Backend build (Maven), REST session 200, Frontend build (Next.js), UI smoke route renders
- [ ] **PERFECT HANDSHAKE:** If part of sequence, ADD next task BEFORE completing
- [ ] Update IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md BEFORE deleting task
