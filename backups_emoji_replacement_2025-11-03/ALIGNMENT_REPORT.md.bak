## Cross-Reference Verification

### Week Numbering Consistency ✅
| File | Week 1 | Week 2 | Week 3 | Week 4-5 | Week 6+ |
|------|--------|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md | ✅ Setup | ✅ Patient Reg | 🔄 Frontend | ⏳ NHIE Sync | ⏳ OPD |
| IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md | ✅ DONE | ✅ DONE | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | ⏳ SCHEDULED | ⏳ PLANNED |
| README.md | ✅ Complete | ✅ Complete | 🔄 In Progress | - | - |
| AGENTS.md | Referenced | Referenced | Referenced | - | - |

**Result**: 100% consistency across all files.

---

### Timeline Consistency ✅
| File | Timeline Stated | Aligned? |
|------|----------------|----------|
| 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md | 20 weeks (Option B) | ✅ YES |
| AGENTS.md | 16-20 weeks | ✅ YES (range includes both options) |
| README.md | 20 weeks | ✅ YES |
| IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md | Phase 1 = Week 1-5 | ✅ YES (matches 20-week plan) |

**Result**: 100% consistency - all files reference 20-week timeline (Option B chosen).

---

### Completion Status Consistency ✅
| Task | 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md | IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md | TASK_HISTORY.md |
|------|--------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------|
| Week 1: Setup | ✅ COMPLETED Nov 1 | ✅ DONE Nov 1 | - (pre-task-queue era) |
| Week 2: Patient Reg | ✅ COMPLETED Nov 1 | ✅ DONE Nov 1 | - (pre-task-queue era) |
| Week 3: Auth Endpoints | ✅ COMPLETE Nov 2 | ✅ COMPLETE Nov 2 | ✅ Task 1 archived Nov 2 |
| Week 3: Report Stubs | ✅ COMPLETE Nov 3 | ✅ COMPLETE Nov 3 | ✅ Task 2 archived Nov 3 |
| Week 3: Frontend Pages | ⏳ in progress | ⏳ Task 3 pending | - (not started) |
| Week 3: API Connections | ⏳ in progress | ⏳ Task 4 pending | - (not started) |

**Result**: 100% consistency - all completion statuses match across files.

## Issues Fixed During Alignment

### Issue 1: Missing Week 3 Definition in 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md ✅ FIXED
**Before**: Document jumped from "Week 2-3: Patient Registration" directly to "Week 4 (Option A) / Week 4-5 (Option B): NHIE Patient Sync"

**Problem**: Week 3 existed in IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md but not in strategic build plan.

**Fix Applied**:
- Inserted 24-line Week 3 section between Week 2 and Week 4-5
- Details: Auth endpoints (✅ COMPLETE Nov 2), Backend report stubs (✅ COMPLETE Nov 3), Frontend pages (⏳ in progress), API connections (⏳ in progress)
- Location: Lines 113-136 of 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md

**Verification**: grep shows Week 3 now appears in both 08_MVP_Build_Strategy.md and IMPLEMENTATION_TRACKER.md with identical content.

---

### Issue 2: Phase Headers Still Showed "Option A / Option B" ✅ FIXED
**Before**: "### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-4 Option A / Week 1-5 Option B)"

**Problem**: Ambiguous - Option B was chosen but headers still showed both options.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed Phase 1 header to "Week 1-5 Option B" (removed Option A reference)
- Changed Phase 2 header to "Week 6-11 Option B" (removed Option A week ranges)
- Changed Phase 3 header to "Week 12-14 Option B" (removed Option A week ranges)
- Changed Phase 4 header to "Week 15-20 Option B" (removed Option A week ranges)
- Removed all "Option A" content from week descriptions

**Verification**: grep shows zero remaining "Option A" references in week sections.

---

### Issue 3: Executive Summary Said "12-16 weeks" ✅ FIXED
**Before**: "Build a **working EMR in 12-16 weeks**"

**Problem**: 12-16 weeks was Option A timeline (HTML Form Entry). Option B (Next.js) is 20 weeks.

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed line 5 from "12-16 weeks" to "20 weeks"
- Changed line 7 from "Week 16" to "Week 20"

**Verification**: Executive summary now correctly states 20-week timeline matching Option B.

---

### Issue 4: README.md Showed "2+ weeks ahead" ✅ FIXED
**Before**: "Current Status: ✅ Week 1 + Week 2-3 Complete (Nov 1, 2025) - **2+ weeks ahead!**"

**Problem**: 
1. Week numbering confusion ("Week 2-3" vs separate Week 2 and Week 3)
2. Progress calculation wrong (Week 3 not complete, so not 2+ weeks ahead)

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed status to "✅ Week 1-2 Complete, 🔄 Week 3 In Progress (Nov 3, 2025) - **1 week ahead!**"
- Split achievements into separate Week 1-2 and Week 3 sections
- Updated development time from "6-8 hours" to "2 weeks for Week 1-3 work" (more realistic)

**Verification**: README.md now accurately reflects current state (Week 3 partially complete, 1 week ahead of 20-week plan).

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (No alignment issues remain)
✅ **COMPLETE** - All documentation aligned to 100%

### Recommended Workflow Improvements

1. **Update AGENTS.md Worker Responsibilities Section (Line ~199)**
   - Current: "Delete Task from PROMPT_QUEUE.md"
   - Recommended: "Delete ENTIRE task section from ## Task N to end of Acceptance Criteria. Empty queue = ~18-21 lines. Verify line count after deletion."
   - Reason: Codex initially only deleted header (left 683 lines of task content) because instruction was ambiguous

2. **Add Task Template Deletion Checklist**
   - Add explicit step in "6. Update Files (MANDATORY)" section:
     ```
     **C. Delete Task from PROMPT_QUEUE.md (ENTIRE SECTION):**
     - Open PROMPT_QUEUE.md
     - Find task header: ## [Icon] Task N: [Title]
     - Select from header to end of Acceptance Criteria (entire section)
     - Delete entire selection
     - Verify file size ~18-21 lines (header + instructions only)
     - Save file
     ```

3. **Weekly Alignment Verification**
   - Run `grep -r "Week [0-9]" *.md docs/**/*.md` weekly
   - Verify week numbers consistent across all files
   - Check for "Option A" references (should be zero)
   - Verify timeline references (should all say "20 weeks")
