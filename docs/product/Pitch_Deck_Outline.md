# Pitch Deck Outline: A Digital Health Partnership with Ghana

**Title:** MedReg: A Partnership for Ghana's Healthcare Technology Independence

**Audience:** Key stakeholders at the Ghana Ministry of Health, Ghana Health Service, and National Health Insurance Authority.

**Core Message:** The previous EMR failure was not a failure of vision, but of model. By embracing an open, sovereign model with MedReg, Ghana can turn that lesson into a national triumph, building a sustainable and independent digital health ecosystem.

### Slide 1: Title

*   **Title:** A Digital Health Partnership for Ghana
*   **Subtitle:** Achieving National Sovereignty, Sustainability, and Scale
*   **Logos:** MedReg & Ministry of Health of Ghana (side-by-side)

### Slide 2: The Challenge: A Shared Understanding

*   **Headline:** We Understand the Challenge
*   **Key Points:**
    *   The $77M LHIMS project failure was a painful but valuable lesson.
    *   The core issue was not technology, but a model based on **vendor dependency**.
    *   This led to data lock-in, service disruption, and a loss of national sovereignty.
*   **Visual:** A diagram showing a locked box labeled "Ghana's Health Data" with a foreign vendor holding the only key.

### Slide 3: The Vision: Ghana's Declaration of Digital Independence

*   **Headline:** A New Mandate for a Sovereign Future
*   **Key Points:** (Quote directly from MoH speeches/documents if possible)
    *   "Every health data/system integration will now exist and occur through the NHIE."
    *   "No vendor will again be able to hold Ghana's patient data to ransom."
    *   "Public health data must be under MoH authority."
*   **Core Message:** This is the right vision. It is a vision of independence, and we are here to help you realize it.

### Slide 4: Our Solution: A Partnership, Not a Product

*   **Headline:** MedReg: Your Partner for Healthcare Technology Independence
*   **Core Message:** We are not another vendor selling a closed product. We are a development partner bringing a proven, open platform: **OpenMRS**.
*   **Three Pillars:**
    1.  **Proven Technology:** OpenMRS is a world-class, open-source EMR used in over 100 countries, including the successful Kenya HIE.
    2.  **Ghana-Centric Approach:** We will adapt this platform for Ghana's specific needs (NHIS, workflows, languages).
    3.  **National Ownership:** Ghana owns the code, the data, and the infrastructure. **Forever.**
*   **Visual:** The locked box is now open, with the key transformed into the Ghana flag, held by a hand representing the MoH.

### Slide 5: How We Deliver: The Three Pillars of Independence

*   **Headline:** From Vision to Reality
*   **Pillar 1: Technical Excellence & NHIE Compliance**

    *   Modern, secure, and reliable.
*   **Pillar 2: Economic Advantage & Sustainability**
    *   **75%+ cost reduction** compared to the previous proprietary model.
    *   No licensing fees. Investment stays in Ghana (training, support, local jobs).
*   **Pillar 3: Strategic Independence & National Ownership**
    *   **Zero vendor lock-in.**
    *   We will help you build a local ecosystem of Ghanaian experts to manage your system.

### Slide 6: The Roadmap to Success

*   **Headline:** A Phased Approach to National Scale
*   **Visual:** A simplified version of the Product Roadmap.

*   **We bring deep African HIE experience.** Our strategy is based on the proven success of the Kenya HIE.
*   **We are committed to your independence.** Our success is measured by how quickly Ghana can manage its own system without us.

### Slide 8: The Ask: A Pilot Partnership

*   **Headline:** Let's Build the Future, Together
