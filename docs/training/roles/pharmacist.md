# Pharmacist Workflow Guide

This guide outlines the primary workflow for a Pharmacist using the Ghana EMR system.

## 1. View Pharmacy Queue

-   Navigate to the "Pharmacy Queue" from the main dashboard.
-   This queue shows patients who have completed their consultation and have pending prescriptions.

## 2. Prepare Medication

-   Select a patient from the queue to view their prescribed medications.
-   The view will detail the drug, dosage, frequency, and duration.

## 3. Dispense Medication

-   After preparing the medication, mark it as "Dispensed" in the system.
-   This action records the dispensation and removes the patient from the active pharmacy queue.

## 4. Patient Counseling

-   Provide the patient with the necessary counseling on how to take their medication.
