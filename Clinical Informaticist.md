🏥 Typical Health Facility Workflow (Ghana/SSA Context)
1. Patient Entry & Registration
Arrival: Patients often walk in without appointments (walk-in model dominates).

Registration Desk:

Patient details recorded in a paper register (name, age, sex, address, sometimes NHIS number).

Returning patients may bring a folder/card kept at the facility or at home.

Queue numbers are issued manually.

Pain point: Duplicate records are common; identifiers are inconsistent.

2. Triage / Vital Signs
Nurse-led step:

Weight, temperature, blood pressure, pulse, sometimes MUAC (for children).

Recorded in a vitals book or on the patient’s folder.

Queueing: Patients then wait for consultation.

Pain point: Data rarely flows forward digitally; clinicians often re-ask.

3. Consultation with Clinician
Clinician (doctor/PA/nurse practitioner):

Reviews patient folder (if available).

Takes history, performs exam, writes diagnosis and treatment plan.

Notes are handwritten in the folder or register.

Decision points:

Prescriptions → pharmacy

Lab requests → lab

Referrals → higher-level facility

Pain point: No structured coding (ICD-10 rarely used at point of care).

4. Laboratory / Diagnostics
Lab request form: Handwritten slip carried by patient to lab.

Lab staff: Perform test, record results in lab register, return slip to patient.

Result delivery: Patient carries result back to clinician.

Pain point: Results can be lost, delayed, or misfiled.

5. Pharmacy / Dispensing
Prescription slip: Patient presents to pharmacy.

Pharmacist/technician: Dispenses drugs, records in dispensing register.

Stock management: Often manual; stock-outs common.

Pain point: No real-time link between prescribing and stock availability.

6. Billing / Insurance (NHIS)
NHIS (National Health Insurance Scheme):

Claims require detailed paper forms and facility registers.

Staff often re-enter data into NHIS claim software.

Private pay: Cash collected at cashier, receipt issued.

Pain point: Double entry, delays in NHIS reimbursement.

7. Reporting & Administration
Monthly reporting:

Facility staff aggregate data from registers (OPD visits, deliveries, immunizations, etc.).

Reports submitted to District Health Information System (DHIS2).

Pain point: Manual tallying is error-prone and time-consuming.

🔑 Insider Observations
Registers are the backbone: Every service point (OPD, MCH, lab, pharmacy) has its own register. Staff are trained to trust these as the “official record.”

Patient as courier: Patients physically carry slips/results between service points.

Hybrid workflows: Even when EMRs exist, staff often keep parallel paper registers “for safety” or because MoH requires them.

Task-shifting: Nurses and physician assistants handle much of the workload, not just doctors.

Power & connectivity issues: Systems must work offline and sync later.

Data for reporting > data for care: Staff are often more focused on filling registers for MoH reporting than on continuity of care.
