MEDIA ENGAGEMENT ON THE SHUTDOWN OF LHIMS AND REMEDIAL MEASURES BEING TAKEN
INTRODUCTION

Over the past several months, Ghana’s public health system has suffered recurring outages and disruptions in the Lightwave Health Information System (LHIMS) used across our hospitals and clinics. In many cases, facilities temporarily lost access to patient records, NHIS eligibility checks, billing and claims submission, and referral history.

In the last three weeks, this escalated into a total shutdown for hundreds of facilities, cutting them off from critical information required to safely treat patients and to submit insurance claims for reimbursement.

The Ministry of Health is addressing this matter publicly because this shutdown has directly affected medical care, particularly NHIS service delivery at the point of care. We also want to be clear about what led us to this point, what actions have been taken to protect the system, and how we are moving forward in a way that permanently prevents this level of risk from recurring.

BACKGROUND & TIMELINE

In March 2019, the Ministry of Health signed a three-year contract valued at USD 100 million with Lightwave eHealth Solutions to deploy a comprehensive health information management system across 950 facilities nationwide.

By the end of 2022, Lightwave had not delivered the 950 facilities required under the contract. The Ministry therefore granted an additional two-year extension, expiring on 31st December 2024, to enable Lightwave to complete delivery of all 950 facilities.

At the end of the extension (31st December 2024), Lightwave had still not fully completed the scope, prompting the Ministry to initiate a comprehensive forensic audit to determine the true status of work delivered, reasons for non-performance, the extent of delivery versus payments, and any gaps in hardware, software, and integrations.

There was therefore no subsisting contract between the Ministry of Health and Lightwave eHealth Solutions at the time I assumed office as the Minister responsible for health.

PRELIMINARY AUDIT FINDINGS

The Ministry commissioned a forensic audit to confirm exactly what had been delivered, what had been paid for, and what was still in use. The preliminary findings were as follows:

The preliminary audit findings confirmed that only 450 facilities have been fully delivered, installed, and verified as operational—less than 50% of the original 950-facility scope.

CONTRACT PERFORMANCE & PAYMENTS

The total amount paid to the Supplier to date is: USD 76,987,886.10 (76.99% of contract value).

UNVERIFIED HARDWARE / SOFTWARE / INTEGRATIONS

Even among verified sites, gaps have been identified in the quantities and specifications of hardware (including tablets, laptops, desktops, servers, storage devices, switches, load balancers, access points and cables, masts and earthings) and certain software/integration components.

The value of these unverified items is estimated at USD 18,913,947.00.

The audit also revealed that the Supplier has been paid USD 10.13 million in excess of work done.

REFUSAL TO HANDOVER SERVERS, STORAGE, AND DATA

Despite contract expiry and repeated demands, Lightwave has refused to hand over administrative access to the physical servers and storage systems installed at the 450 verified facilities, contrary to clause 2(b) and 3 of the said contract.

The Supplier has also refused to grant access to the healthcare data of Ghanaians stored on these systems. This data is the property of the Republic of Ghana and its citizens and can never lawfully be the property of a private vendor.

No dataset transfers, no administrative access to storage, and no handover of healthcare records were provided during the five-year period, even after milestone payments were made in full.

The continued custody of Ghanaians’ healthcare data by a private entity without lawful access by the Government poses serious risks to national sovereignty; accordingly, the national security agencies have been formally notified and are engaged.

THE MINISTRY’S GOOD-FAITH EFFORTS (AND WHY ACCESS IS NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Despite this underperformance, the system they were running sat in critical service points across the country. In order to prevent disruption to care in the 450 facilities that were actually in use, the Ministry was prepared to consider an interim two-year service and licence agreement that would cover only those 450 sites.

However, during these discussions the Supplier refused to accept any clause that guaranteed the Republic access to its own health data and explicitly rejected any agreement that provided for data access, handover, or state custody of data.

That position contradicts the provisions of the Public Procurement Act and the Data Protection Act: the State cannot surrender sovereign control of public health information, and no data processor acting on behalf of the Republic can deny the data controller—the Republic—access to patient data.

When the Ministry insisted on those protections, the vendor escalated. After periods of switching facilities on and off, the vendor shut the system down entirely for several hundreds of health facilities, cutting hospitals off from records, insurance verification, banking payments, claims and referral histories, and throwing parts of the public health system into darkness.

THE WAY FORWARD

In light of the nationwide complete shutdown of LHIMS service, the Ministry of Health has initiated emergency stabilisation measures across public and mission health facilities.

These disruptions have demonstrated that it is no longer acceptable for a single private vendor to control access to clinical data, national insurance integrations, or facility-level billing infrastructure.

THE NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION EXCHANGE (NHIE)

Right after the nationwide shutdown, the Ministry of Health moved the country off supplier-controlled infrastructure and established the National Health Information Exchange (NHIE) on state infrastructure.

The Exchange is now the national backbone for health data: it is the secure system through which every health data/system integration will now exist and occur. Health facilities can look up a patient, confirm NHIS eligibility, submit and track claims, view referral and treatment history, and continue care even if their local system goes down.

SOVEREIGN DATA RECOVERY: REBUILDING THE COUNTRY’S PATIENT HISTORY

Because the Supplier refused to hand over full administrative access to the servers and data—including databases sitting in facilities that were government funded—the Ministry was forced to reconstruct Ghana’s clinical history from sovereign data sources.

We used nationally held datasets such as the NHIS claims databases to rebuild care records for the affected public network of 450 facilities.

So far we have reconstructed the profiles of roughly 14 million patients who have used public health services since 2023, and about 72 million recorded patient visits/encounters over that same period.

The plan is to continue rolling this reconstruction backwards to 2019, so we maintain longitudinal care history, insurance linkage, folder numbers, and referral trails under state custody—not vendor custody.

THE GHANA HEALTH INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (GHIMS)

To stabilise service in all affected facilities, the Ministry is rolling out a new state-controlled electronic medical records platform to be known as the Ghana Health Information Management System (GHIMS). GHIMS is fully integrated with the NHIE and will become the authorised platform for patient registration, clinical documentation, insurance eligibility checks, billing, NHIS claims, referrals and continuity-of-care data.

Deployment of GHIMS begins the week of Monday, 3rd November 2025. The first wave will bring about 200 out of the 450 health facilities back online, which includes all teaching hospitals and all regional hospitals, together with selected high-volume district hospitals, polyclinics, health centres, and CHPS facilities.

The following week, the remaining sites in the original 450 will be added. The goal is that during November, every one of those 450 facilities is reactivated, stabilised, and operating under state control, and are fully transacting again—including billing and claims—through national infrastructure rather than vendor infrastructure.

DEMOCRATISATION OF HEALTH FACILITY ROLL-OUT GOING FORWARD

Finally, Ghana is changing the model going forward. The original single-vendor approach has failed to deliver universal coverage: roughly 500 facilities under that contract were never digitised. Those remaining facilities will not be handed to any one supplier.

Beginning now, the Ministry will open an Expression of Interest process so qualified electronic medical record providers operating in Ghana can be assessed and shortlisted. In 2026, work on those outstanding 500 facilities will be awarded across multiple approved vendors.

All such systems will be required to integrate through the National Health Information Exchange (NHIE), not directly into NHIA or hospital billing lines. That means no vendor will again be able to hold Ghana’s patient data, revenue flow, or service continuity to ransom. It also means faster national rollout, more local participation, more accountability, and permanent protection of the country’s health data under the authority of the Ministry of Health.
